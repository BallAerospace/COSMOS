# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.

stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - run
  # - build
  # - test

run-job:
  stage: run
  script:
    - pwd; ls; cosmos --version

# build-job:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
#   stage: build
#   script:
#     - cd cosmos; bundle install; rake build

# unit-test-job:   # This job runs in the test stage.
#   stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
#   script:
#     - cd cosmos; rake spec

# lint-test-job:   # This job also runs in the test stage.
#   stage: test    # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).
#   script:
#     - cd cosmos; rubocop
