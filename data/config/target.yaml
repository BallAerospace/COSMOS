REQUIRE:
  summary: Requires a Ruby file
  description: Ruby files must be required to be available to call in other code.
    Files are first required from the target's lib folder. If no file is found the
    Ruby system path is checked which includes the base COSMOS/lib folder.
  example: REQUIRE limits_response.rb
  parameters:
    - name: Filename
      required: true
      description: Filename to require. For files in the target's lib directory
        simply supply the filename, e.g. "REQUIRE my_file". Files in the base COSMOS
        lib directory also should just list the filename. If a file is in a folder
        under the lib directory then you must specify the folder name, e.g. "REQUIRE
        folder/my_file". The filename can also be an absolute path but this is not
        common. Note the ".rb" extension is optional when specifying the filename.
      values: .+
IGNORE_PARAMETER:
  summary: Ignore the given command parameter
  description: Hint to other COSMOS tools to hide or ignore this command parameter
    when processing the command. For example, Command Sender and Command Sequence
    will not display the parameter (by default) when showing the command and Script
    Runner code completion will not display the parameter.
  example: IGNORE_PARAMETER CCSDS_VERSION
  parameters:
    - name: Parameter Name
      required: true
      description: The name of a command parameter. Note that this parameter will
        be ignored in ALL the commands it appears in.
      values: .+
IGNORE_ITEM:
  summary: Ignore the given telemetry item
  description: Hint to other COSMOS tools to hide or ignore this telemetry item
    when processing the telemetry. For example, Packet Viewer will not display the
    item (by default) when showing the packet.
  example: IGNORE_ITEM CCSDS_VERSION
  parameters:
    - name: Item name
      required: true
      description: The name of a telemetry item. Note that this item will be ignored
        in ALL the telemetry it appears in.
      values: .+
COMMANDS:
  summary: Process the given command definition file
  description: This keyword is used to explicitly add the command definition file
    to the list of command and telemetry files to process.
  warning: Usage of this keyword overrides automatic command and telemetry file
    discovery. If this keyword is used, you must also use the TELEMETRY keyword
    to specify the telemetry files to process.
  example: |
    COMMANDS inst_cmds_v2.txt
    TELEMETRY inst_tlm_v2.txt
  parameters:
    - name: Filename
      required: true
      description: Name of a command definition file in the target's cmd_tlm directory, e.g. "cmd.txt".
      values: '.*\.txt'
TELEMETRY:
  summary: Process the given telemetry definition file
  description: This keyword is used to explicitly add the telemetry definition
    file to the list of command and telemetry files to process.
  warning: Usage of this keyword overrides automatic command and telemetry file
    discovery. If this keyword is used, you must also use the COMMAND keyword to
    specify the command files to process.
  example: |
    COMMANDS inst_cmds_v2.txt
    TELEMETRY inst_tlm_v2.txt
  parameters:
    - name: Filename
      required: true
      description: Name of a telemetry definition file in the target's cmd_tlm
        directory, e.g. "tlm.txt".
      values: '.*\.txt'
AUTO_SCREEN_SUBSTITUTE:
  summary: Automatically substitute the target's name in screen definitions
  description: Targets can be renamed when they are declared which would break
    any screen definitions using the explicit target name. This keyword automatically
    replaces the target name in the screen definitions with the actual target name.
  warning: Replaces ALL target names in a screen definition file, so this is not
    suitable for screens with multiple targets.
CMD_UNIQUE_ID_MODE:
  summary: Flags that commands to this target are identified in a mixed variety of ways
  description: Ideally all commands for a target are identified using the exact same fields in a header
    for each command.  If  this target identifies packets using different fields for some commands than others,
    then this flag must be set to force a brute force identification method.
  warning: Using this mode significantly slows packet identification
TLM_UNIQUE_ID_MODE:
  summary: Flags that telemetry to this target are identified in a mixed variety of ways
  description: Ideally all telemetry for a target are identified using the exact same fields in a header
    for each packet.  If  this target identifies packets using different fields for some telemetry packets than others,
    then this flag must be set to force a brute force identification method.
  warning: Using this mode significantly slows packet identification
