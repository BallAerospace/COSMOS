AUTO_DECLARE_TARGETS:
  summary: Automatically load all the target folders under config/targets into the system
  description: When automatically discovering target folders the COSMOS naming convention
    must be followed. Target folders must be uppercase and be named according to how
    COSMOS will access them. For example, if you create a config/targets/INST directory,
    COSMOS will create a target named 'INST' which is how it will be referenced.
    This keyword is REQUIRED unless you individually declare your targets using the
    DECLARE_TARGET keyword.
DECLARE_TARGET:
  summary: Declare a COSMOS target and name it
  description: Declare target is used in place of AUTO_DECLARE_TARGETS to give more
    fine grained control over how the target folder is loaded and named within COSMOS.
    This is required if AUTO_DECLARE_TARGET is not present.
  example: DECLARE_TARGET INST INST2 inst.txt
  parameters:
    - name: Target Name
      required: true
      description: The directory name which contains the target information.
        This must match a directory under config/targets.

    - name: Substitute Target Name
      required: false
      description: The target name in the COSMOS system. This is how the target
        will be referred to in scripts. If this is not given (or given as nil)
        the target name will be the directory name given above.
    - name: Target Filename
      required: false
      description: The name of the file in the target directory which contains the
        configuration information for the target. By default this is 'target.txt'
        but if you want to rename this you need to set this parameter.
DECLARE_GEM_TARGET:

      required: true
      description: The COSMOS gem name which must be cosmos-<gem-name> where <gem-name>

  description: COSMOS targets can be distributed in gem form in which case they
    must be named 'cosmos-<gem-name>' where <gem-name> is the descriptive name of
    the gem. Multiple Targets can be packaged into a single gem. This directive
    will tell COSMOS where to look for a target inside the first directory level
    of the gem.  The sub-directory name must be all uppercase and must contain a
    sub-directory named 'cmd_tlm'. See the COSMOS documentation at cosmosrb.com
    for for information on creating a COSMOS gem target.

        the CTS_API and TLMVIEWER_API are bound to localhost meaning that only tools
        on the same machine can connect. By default, CTS_PREIDENTIFIED and CTS_CMD_ROUTER
        are bound to '0.0.0.0' to allow for tools on any machines to connect. This
        allows for chaining two or more Servers out of the box.

    affects packet receive times, timestamped log filenames, message logs,
    Cmd/Tlm extractor time ranges, etc.
  since: 3.10.0
ADD_HASH_FILE:
  summary: Add a file to the hashing sum calculation
  description: Adds a file to the set of files used in marshal file hashing sum calculation.
    Upon startup, COSMOS calculates a hashing sum over the command/telemetry definition files
    for all targets. After the definitions have been processed, COSMOS saves the resulting
    objects as marshal files in a folder with the hashing sum as part of the name.
    The next time COSMOS runs, if the hashing sum of the cmd/tlm definition files
    has not changed, COSMOS can load the marshal files instead of re-processing the definitions.
    If a file is specified with the ADD_HASH_FILE keyword, COSMOS will include it in the
    hashing sum calculation. This means that a change in the file will cause COSMOS to
    re-process the cmd/tlm defintions and create a new set of marshal files.
    The default hashing algorithm is MD5, but other Ruby Digest algorithms are also supported,
    like SHA1 and SHA256
  since: 4.4.0
  example: ADD_HASH_FILE lib/user_version.rb
