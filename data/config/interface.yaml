TARGET:
  summary: Maps a target name to an interface
  parameters:
    - name: Target Name
      required: true
      description: Target name to map to this interface
      values: <%= System.targets.keys %>
DONT_CONNECT:
  summary: Server will not automatically try to connect to the interface at startup
DONT_RECONNECT:
  summary: Server will not try to reconnect to the interface if the connection is lost
RECONNECT_DELAY:
  summary: Reconnect delay in seconds
  description: If DONT_RECONNECT is not present the Server will try to reconnect to an
    interface if the connection is lost. Reconnect delay sets the interval in seconds
    between reconnect tries.
  parameters:
    - name: Delay
      required: true
      description: Delay in seconds between reconnect attempts. The default is 15 seconds.
      values: ([0-9]*[.])?[0-9]+
DISABLE_DISCONNECT:
  summary: Disable the Disconnect button on the Interfaces tab in the Server
  description: Use this keyword to prevent the user from disconnecting from the interface.
    This is typically used in a 'production' environment where you would not want
    the user to inadvertantly disconnect from a target.
LOG:
  summary: Enable logging on the interface by the specified log writer
  description: LOG is only required if you want a log writer other than the default
    to log commands and telemetry on this interface
  warning: Choosing a custom log writer can prevent COSMOS from reading back your log files
  parameters:
    - name: Name
      required: true
      description: Log writer name as defined by PACKET_LOG_WRITER
      values: \D\S*
DONT_LOG:
  summary: Disable logging commands and telemetry on this interface
LOG_RAW:
  summary: Log all data on the interface exactly as it is sent and received
  description: LOG_RAW does not add any COSMOS headers and thus can not be read by COSMOS tools.
    It is primarily useful for low level debugging of an interface. You will have to
    manually parse these logs yourself using a hex editor or other application.
