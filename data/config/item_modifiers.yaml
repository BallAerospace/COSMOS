STATE:
  summary: Defines a key/value pair for the current item
  description: Key value pairs allow for user friendly strings. For example,
    you might define states for ON = 1 and OFF = 0. This allows the word ON to be
    used rather than the number 1 when sending the telemetry item and allows
    for much greater clarity and less chance for user error.
  example: |
    APPEND_ITEM ENABLE 32 UINT "Enable setting"
      STATE FALSE 0
      STATE TRUE 1
    APPEND_ITEM STRING 1024 STRING "String"
      STATE "NOOP" "NOOP" GREEN
      STATE "ARM LASER" "ARM LASER" YELLOW
      STATE "FIRE LASER" "FIRE LASER" RED
  parameters:
    - name: Key
      required: true
      description: The string state name
      values: .*
    - name: Value
      required: true
      description: The numerical state value
      values: .*
    - name: Color
      required: false
      description: The color the state should be displayed as
      values: ['GREEN', 'YELLOW', 'RED']
READ_CONVERSION:
  summary: Applies a conversion to the current telemetry item
  description: Conversions are implemented in a custom Ruby file which should be
    located in the target's lib folder and required by the target's target.txt
    file (see REQUIRE). The class must require 'cosmos/conversions/conversion'
    and inherit from Conversion. It must implement the initialize method if it
    takes extra parameters and must always implement the call method. The conversion
    factor is applied to the raw value in the telemetry packet before it is displayed
    to the user. The user still has the ability to see the raw unconverted value
    in a details dialog.
  example: |
    READ_CONVERSION the_great_conversion.rb 1000

    Defined in the_great_conversion.rb:

    require 'cosmos/conversions/conversion'
    module Cosmos
      class TheGreatConversion < Conversion
        def initialize(multiplier)
          super()
          @multiplier = multiplier.to_f
        end
        def call(value, packet, buffer)
          return value * multiplier
        end
      end
    end
  parameters:
    - name: Class File Name
      required: true
      description: The file name which contains the Ruby class. The file name must
        be named after the class such that the class is a CamelCase version of the
        underscored file name. For example, 'the_great_conversion.rb' should contain
        'class TheGreatConversion'.
      values: .*\.rb
    - name: Parameter
      required: false
      description: Additional parameter values for the conversion which are passed
        to the class constructor.
      values: .*
POLY_READ_CONVERSION:
  summary: Adds a polynomial conversion factor to the current telemetry item
  description: The conversion factor is applied to raw value in the telemetry
    packet before it is displayed to the user. The user still has the ability
    to see the raw unconverted value in a details dialog.
  example: POLY_READ_CONVERSION 10 0.5 0.25
  parameters:
    - name: C0
      required: true
      description: Coefficient
      values: .*
    - name: Cx
      required: false
      description: Additional coefficient values for the conversion. Any order
        polynomial conversion may be used so the value of 'x' will vary with the
        order of the polynomial. Note that larger order polynomials take longer
        to process than shorter order polynomials, but are sometimes more accurate.
      values: .*
SEG_POLY_READ_CONVERSION:
  summary: Adds a segmented polynomial conversion factor to the current telemetry item
  description: This conversion factor is applied to the raw value in the telemetry packet
    before it is displayed to the user. The user still has the ability to see the raw
    unconverted value in a details dialog.
  example: |
    SEG_POLY_READ_CONVERSION 0 10 0.5 0.25 # Apply the conversion to all values < 50
    SEG_POLY_READ_CONVERSION 50 11 0.5 0.275 # Apply the conversion to all values >= 50 and < 100
    SEG_POLY_READ_CONVERSION 100 12 0.5 0.3 # Apply the conversion to all values >= 100
  parameters:
    - name: Lower Bound
      required: true
      description: Defines the lower bound of the range of values that this segmented
        polynomial applies to. Is ignored for the segment with the smallest lower bound.
      values: .*
    - name: C0
      required: true
      description: Coefficient
      values: .*
    - name: Cx
      required: false
      description: Additional coefficient values for the conversion. Any order
        polynomial conversion may be used so the value of 'x' will vary with the
        order of the polynomial. Note that larger order polynomials take longer
        to process than shorter order polynomials, but are sometimes more accurate.
      values: .*
GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_START:
  summary: Start a generic read conversion
  description: Adds a generic conversion function to the current telemetry item.
    This conversion factor is applied to the raw value in the telemetry packet
    before it is displayed to the user. The user still has the ability to see the
    raw unconverted value in a details dialog. The conversion is specified as
    ruby code that receives two implied parameters. 'value' which is the raw
    value being read and 'packet' which is a reference to the telemetry packet
    class (Note, referencing the packet as 'myself' is still supported for backwards
    compatibility). The last line of ruby code given should return the converted
    value. The GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_END keyword specifies that all lines of
    ruby code for the conversion have been given.
  warning: Generic conversions are not a good long term solution. Consider creating
    a conversion class and using READ_CONVERSION instead. READ_CONVERSION is easier
    to debug and higher performance.
  example: |
    APPEND_ITEM ITEM1 32 UINT
      GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_START
        value * 1.5  # Convert the value by a scale factor
      GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_END
  parameters:
    - name: Converted Type
      required: false
      description: Type of the converted value
      values: <%= %w(INT UINT FLOAT STRING BLOCK) %>
    - name: Converted Bit Size
      required: false
      description: Bit size of converted value
      values: \d+
GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_END:
  summary: Complete a generic read conversion
LIMITS:
  summary: Defines a set of limits for a telemetry item
  description: If limits are violated a message is printed in the Command and Telemetry Server
    to indicate an item went out of limits. Other tools also use this information
    to update displays with different colored telemetry items or other useful information.
    The concept of "limits sets" is defined to allow for different limits values
    in different environments. For example, you might want tighter or looser limits
    on telemetry if your environment changes such as during thermal vacuum testing.
  example: |
    LIMITS DEFAULT 3 ENABLED -80.0 -70.0 60.0 80.0 -20.0 20.0
    LIMITS TVAC 3 ENABLED -80.0 -30.0 30.0 80.0
  parameters:
    - name: Limits Set
      required: true
      description: Name of the limits set. If you have no unique limits sets use
        the keyword DEFAULT.

    - name: Persistence
      required: true
      description: Number of consecutive times the telemetry item must be within
        a different limits range before changing limits state.
      values: \d+
    - name: Initial State
      required: true
      description: Whether limits monitoring for this telemetry item is initially enabled or disabled.
        Note if you have multiple LIMITS items they should all have the same initial state.
      values: ['ENABLED', 'DISABLED']
    - name: Red Low Limit
      required: true
      description: If the telemetry value is less than or equal to this value a

      values: .+
    - name: Yellow Low Limit
      required: true
      description: If the telemetry value is less than or equal to this value,

  example: LIMITS_RESPONSE example_limits_response.rb 10
  parameters:
    - name: Response Class Filename
      required: true
