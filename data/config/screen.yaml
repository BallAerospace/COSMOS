      description: Width in pixels or AUTO to let Telemetry Viewer automatically
        layout the screen
      values: \d+
    - name: Height
      required: true
      description: Height in pixels or AUTO to let Telemetry Viewer automatically

  description: All layout widgets must be closed to properly identify where they
    stop. For example, a VERTICALBOX keyword must be matched with an END keyword
    to indicate where the VERTICALBOX ends.
GLOBAL_SETTING:
  summary: Applies a widget setting to all widgets of a certain type
  parameters:
    - name: Widget Class Name
      required: true
      description: The name of the class of widgets that this setting will be
        applied to. For example, LABEL or BUTTON.
      values: .+
    - name: Setting Name
      required: true
      description: Widget specific setting name. COSMOS defines several settings
        which apply across many different widget types. However, you can also use
        the 'RAW' setting which allows any stylesheet values that QT supports.
        See the QT Stylesheet documentation for more information.
      values: <%= %w(TEXTALIGN PADDING MARGIN BACKCOLOR TEXTCOLOR BORDERCOLOR WIDTH HEIGHT RAW) %>
    - name: Setting Value(s)
      required: false
      description: >
        The setting value which varies by setting. Note that color
        settings can be given as a common string, e.g. 'red', or by RGB values,
        e.g. 255 0 0. If the setting is RAW the value should be the raw stylesheet
        string, e.g. "font-size: 10px"
      values: .*
GLOBAL_SUBSETTING:
  summary: Applies a widget subsetting to all widgets of a certain type
  description: Subsettings are only valid for widgets that are
    made up of more than one subwidget. For example, LABELVALUE is made up of a LABEL
    at subwidget index 0 and a VALUE at subwidget index 1. This allows for passing
    settings to specific subwidgets. Some widgets are made up of multiple subwidgets,
    e.g. LABELVALUELIMITSBAR. To set the label text color, pass '0:0' as the Subwidget
    Index to first index the LABELVALUE and then the LABEL.
  parameters:
    - name: Widget Class Name
      required: true
      description: The name of the class of widgets that this setting will be
        applied to. For example, LABELVALUE.

NAMED_WIDGET:
  summary: Name a widget to allow access to it via the get_named_widget method
  description: To programatically access parts of a telemetry screen you need

    read values from other widgets.
  warning: get_named_widget returns the widget itself and thus must be operated
    on using methods native to that widget
