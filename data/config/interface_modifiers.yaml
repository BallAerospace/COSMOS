TARGET:
  summary: Maps a target name to an interface
  parameters:
    - name: Target Name
      required: true
      description: Target name to map to this interface
      values: <%= System.targets.keys %>
DONT_CONNECT:
  summary: Server will not automatically try to connect to the interface at startup
DONT_RECONNECT:
  summary: Server will not try to reconnect to the interface if the connection is lost
RECONNECT_DELAY:
  summary: Reconnect delay in seconds
  description: If DONT_RECONNECT is not present the Server will try to reconnect to an
    interface if the connection is lost. Reconnect delay sets the interval in seconds
    between reconnect tries.
  parameters:
    - name: Delay
      required: true
      description: Delay in seconds between reconnect attempts. The default is 15 seconds.
      values: ([0-9]*[.])?[0-9]+
DISABLE_DISCONNECT:
  summary: Disable the Disconnect button on the Interfaces tab in the Server
  description: Use this keyword to prevent the user from disconnecting from the interface.
    This is typically used in a 'production' environment where you would not want
    the user to inadvertantly disconnect from a target.
LOG:
  summary: Enable logging on the interface by the specified log writer
  description: LOG is only required if you want a log writer other than the default
    to log commands and telemetry on this interface
  warning: Choosing a custom log writer can prevent COSMOS from reading back your log files
  parameters:
    - name: Name
      required: true
      description: Log writer name as defined by PACKET_LOG_WRITER
      values: \D\S*
LOG_STORED:
  summary: Enable logging of stored telemetry on the interface by the specified log writer
  description: LOG_STORED allows you to specify a different log writer for stored telemetry
    (telemetry which has the 'stored' flag set in the packet). By default the stored telemetry
    is intermingled in the normal log file.
  warning: Choosing a custom log writer can prevent COSMOS from reading back your log files
  parameters:
    - name: Name
      required: true
      description: Log writer name as defined by PACKET_LOG_WRITER
      values: \D\S*
DONT_LOG:
  summary: Disable logging commands and telemetry on this interface
LOG_RAW:
  summary: Log all data on the interface exactly as it is sent and received
  description: LOG_RAW does not add any COSMOS headers and thus can not be read by COSMOS tools.
    It is primarily useful for low level debugging of an interface. You will have to
    manually parse these logs yourself using a hex editor or other application.
PROTOCOL:
  summary: Protocols modify the interface by processing the data
  description: Protocols can be either READ, WRITE, or READ_WRITE. READ protocols act on the data
    received by the interface while write acts on the data before it is sent out. READ_WRITE applies
    the protocol to both reading and writing.<br/><br/>
    There is only one built in protocol implemented by override_protocol.rb.
    This protocol allows for Scripts to use the override_tlm() and normalize_tlm() methods to permanently
    change a telemetry value. Note, this differs from set_tlm() as set_tlm() is over-written by new
    incoming telemetry.<br/><br/>
    For information on creating your own custom protocol please see <a href="http://cosmosrb.com/docs/protocols">cosmosrb.com/docs/protocols</a>
  since: 4.0.0
  parameters:
    - name: Type
      required: true
      description: Whether to apply the protocol on incoming data, outgoing data, or both
      values: ['READ', 'WRITE', 'READ_WRITE']
    - name: Protocol Filename or Classname
      required: true
      description: Ruby file name or class name which implements the protocol
      values: .*
    - name: Protocol specific parameters
      required: false
      description: Additional parameters used by the protocol
OPTION:
  summary: Set a parameter on an interface
  description: When an option is set the interface class calls the set_option method.
    Custom interfaces can override set_option to handle any additional options they want.
  parameters:
    - name: Name
      required: true
      description: The option to set. COSMOS defines several options on the core provided
        interfaces. The SerialInterface defines FLOW_CONTROL which can be NONE (default) or RTSCTS
        and DATA_BITS which changes the data bits of the serial interface.
        The TcpipServerInterface defines LISTEN_ADDRESS which is the IP address to accept
        connections on (default 0.0.0.0) and AUTO_SYSTEM_META which will automatically send
        SYSTEM META when the interface connects (default false).
      values: .*
    - name: Parameters
      required: false
      description: Parameters to pass to the option
      values: .*
