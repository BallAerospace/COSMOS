Ball Aerospace COSMOS has been featured in a blog post on [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2022). SparkFun is an online retail store that sells electronics primarily for hobbyists. Ball recently purchased a Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and various other parts to interface to COSMOS. We think hobbyists will find COSMOS a great way to interface to their embedded projects and SparkFun agrees! [Get started](http://cosmosrb.bom/docs/installation) with COSMOS now!
