Ball Aerospace COSMOS has been featured in a blog post on [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2022). SparkFun is an online retail store that sells electronics primarily for hobbyists. Ball recently purchased a Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and various other parts to interface to COSMOS. We think hobbyists will find COSMOS a great way to interface to their embedded projects and SparkFun agrees! [Get started](http://cosmosc2.com/docs/v4/installation) with COSMOS now!

A Ball engineer wrote a [Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/dholshouser/alagna/wiki/HowTo) on how he configured COSMOS to talk to his Arduino Uno. It's a little old but it gives a nice step by step tutorial on how to use COSMOS with an Arduino.
