Welcome to COSMOS 4.3.0!

The highlight of this release is built in support for differentiating between stored telemetry and realtime telemetry. If your system downlinks stored telemetry that you don't want to interfere with the COSMOS realtime current value table, your interface/protocol code can set the stored flag on a packet before returning it to COSMOS to have COSMOS log the packet, but not update the current telemetry values.

Lots of other new features as well, and a few bug fixes including fixing running on the latest version of Mac OSX. See below for the full list.

Breaking Changes:
The COSMOS log file format and predentified protocol formats have changed to support stored telemetry. COSMOS 4.3 is backwards compatible with earlier formats, but older versions of COSMOS won't be able to read files from COSMOS 4.3+.

### New Features:

- [#780](https://github.com/BallAerospace/COSMOS/issues/780) Search bar support for Command Sequence

- [#819](https://github.com/BallAerospace/COSMOS/issues/819) Ensure x values added in incrementing order in TlmGrapher
- [#823](https://github.com/BallAerospace/COSMOS/issues/823) Add protocol to ignore any packet
- [#826](https://github.com/BallAerospace/COSMOS/issues/826) Allow hash style access to Excel
- [#829](https://github.com/BallAerospace/COSMOS/issues/829) Add STAY_ON_TOP feature to telemetry screens
