Ball Aerospace COSMOS has been featured in a [blog post](http://www.williamosman.com/2016/08/cosmos-and-arduino-20-telemetry-system.html) by [William Osman](http://www.williamosman.com/) about creating a telemetry system for a race car. William mentions first seeing COSMOS in action on the set of Battle Bots [Season 2](http://www.battlebots.com/bracket-s2/) where [Team Chomp](http://battlebots.com/robot/chomp-2/) was using it enroute to their quarterfinal finish. What an awesome example of COSMOS in action!
