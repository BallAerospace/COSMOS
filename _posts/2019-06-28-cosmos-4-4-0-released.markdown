Here's COSMOS 4.4.0! 52 tickets have been incorporated including 18 new features, 19 bug fixes and 15 general maintenance changes.

Overall this is just a stability bug fix release, but there are a few interesting changes. For one, max packet reception speed has been greatly increased due to ticket #911. CmdExtractor can now output in a CSV format. ScriptRunner has a recently opened file menu section, and the show_backtrace feature is now a menu option as well. There is much better support for giving absolute paths to config files on the command line. There is also a new LED type widget to display boolean telemetry.

Enjoy and see below for the full list of changes.

### Breaking Changes:

The faster identification in ticket #911 does come with a potentially breaking change. The improvement requires that all packets for a given target be identified using the same fields (bit offset, bit_size, and type). This is the typical configuration, and breaking this pattern is typically a dangerous/bad choice for interfaces anyways, but previously COSMOS did default to handling packets being potentially identified using different fields in the same target. If you have a target that still requires that functionality, you need to declare CMD_UNIQUE_ID_MODE, and/or TLM_UNIQUE_ID_MODE in the target's target.txt file to indicate it should use the slower identification method.
