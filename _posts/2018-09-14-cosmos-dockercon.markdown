Ball Aerospace COSMOS has been featured in a [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnWXOAplvjY&feature=youtu.be&t=9m) by Chris Heistand from [John Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory](http://www.jhuapl.edu/). He's working on the [Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART)](http://dart.jhuapl.edu/) not to be confused with COSMOS [DART](/docs/dart_overview). They have setup COSMOS to run in a Docker container which X fowards to a X11Server VNC container which they then use a VNC Client to connect to. Pretty cool stuff which we we will hopefully have more out of the box support for in the future. Stay tuned!
