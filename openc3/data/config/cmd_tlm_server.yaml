TITLE:
  summary: Sets the Command and Telemetry Server window title
  parameters:
  - name: Text
    required: true
    description: Text to put in the title of the Command and Telemetry Server window
    values: .+
PACKET_LOG_WRITER:
  summary: Declare a packet log writer
  description: Packet log writer is used to declare a packet log writer class and
    give it a name which can be referenced by an interface. This is required if you
    want interfaces to have their own dedicated log writers or want to combine
    various interfaces into a single log file. By default, OpenC3 logs all data
    on all interfaces into a single command log and a single telemetry log.
    This keyword can also be used if you want to declare a different log file class
    to create log files.
  warning: You should NOT override the default without consulting a OpenC3 expert
    as this may break the ability to successfully read and write log files.
  example: |
    PACKET_LOG_WRITER DEFAULT packet_log_writer.rb # Default
    # The default logger filename will be <DATE>_openc3tlm.bin and will create a new log every 1MB
    PACKET_LOG_WRITER DEFAULT packet_log_writer.rb openc3 true nil 1000000
    # Create a logger named OPENC3_LOG which creates a new log every 5 min (600s)
    PACKET_LOG_WRITER OPENC3_LOG packet_log_writer.rb openc3 true 600
  parameters:
    - name: Log Writer Name
      required: true
      description: The name of the log writer as reference by other cmd_tlm_server keywords.
        This name also appears in the Logging tab on the Command and Telemetry Server.
      values: .+
    - name: Filename
      required: true
      description: Ruby file to use when instantiating a new log writer
      values: '.+\.rb'
    - name: Parameters
      required: false
      description: Optional parameters to pass to the log writer class when instantiating it.
AUTO_INTERFACE_TARGETS:
  summary: Automatically use each target's cmd_tlm_server.txt file to define the interface
  description: Look for a cmd_tlm_server.txt file at the top level
    of each target directory and use this file to configure the interface for that target.
    This is a good way of keeping the knowledge of how to interface to a target
    within that target. However, if you use substitute target names (by using DECLARE_TARGET)
    or use different IP addresses then this will not work and you'll have to use the
    INTERFACE_TARGET or INTERFACE keyword.
INTERFACE_TARGET:
  summary: Load the specified target's cmd_tlm_server.txt configuration file
  example: |
    INTERFACE_TARGET OPENC3 # Look in the OPENC3 target directory for cmd_tlm_server.txt
    INTERFACE_TARGET OPENC3 config.txt # Look in the OPENC3 target directory for config.txt
  parameters:
    - name: Target Name
      required: true
      description: Name of the target
      values: .+
    - name: Configuration File
      required: false
      description: Configuration filename which contains the interface configuration.
        Defaults to 'cmd_tlm_server.txt'.
      values: .+
INTERFACE:
  modifiers:
    <%= MetaConfigParser.load('interface_modifiers.yaml').to_meta_config_yaml(4) %>
  summary: Defines a connection to a physical target
  description: Interfaces are what OpenC3 uses to talk to a particular piece
    of hardware. Interfaces require a Ruby file which implements all the interface
    methods necessary to talk to the hardware. OpenC3 defines many built in interfaces
    or you can define your own as long as it implements the interface protocol.
  parameters:
    - name: Interface Name
      required: true
      description: Name of the interface. This name will appear in the
        Interfaces tab of the Server and is also referenced by other keywords.
        The OpenC3 convention is to name interfaces after their targets with
        '_INT' appended to the name, e.g. INST_INT for the INST target.
      values: \D\S*
    - name: Filename
      required: true
      description: Ruby file to use when instantiating the interface.
      values:
        <%= MetaConfigParser.load('_interfaces.yaml').to_meta_config_yaml(8) %>
      documentation: Additional parameters are required. Please see the [Interfaces](/docs/v5/interfaces)
        documentation for more details.
ROUTER:
  modifiers:
    ROUTE:
      summary: Map an interface to a router
      description: Once an interface has been mapped to a router, all its received telemetry
        will be sent out through the router.
      parameters:
        - name: Interface
          required: true
          description: Name of the interface
          values: .+
    <%= MetaConfigParser.load('interface_modifiers.yaml').to_meta_config_yaml(4) %>
  summary: Create an interface which reverses cmd/tlm data
  description: Router creates an interface which receives command packets from
    their remote targets and send them out their interfaces. They receive telemetry
    packets from their interfaces and send them to their remote targets. This allows
    routers to be intermediaries between an external client and an actual device.
  parameters:
    - name: Name
      required: true
      description: Name of the router
      values: .+
    - name: Filename
      required: true
      description: Ruby file to use when instantiating the interface.
      values:
        <%= MetaConfigParser.load('_interfaces.yaml').to_meta_config_yaml(8) %>
      documentation: Additional parameters are required. Please see the [Interfaces](/docs/v5/interfaces)
        documentation for more details.
COLLECT_METADATA:
  summary: Prompts the user for meta data when starting the Command and Telemetry Server
BACKGROUND_TASK:
  modifiers:
    STOPPED:
      summary: Indicate the background task should not be automatically started
  summary: Create a background task in the Command and Telemetry Server
  description: The Server instantiates the class which must inherit from BackgroundTask
    and then calls the call() method which the class must implement. The call() method
    is only called once so if your background task is supposed to live on while the
    Server is running, you must implement your code in a loop with a sleep to not
    use all the CPU.
  example: BACKGROUND_TASK example_background_task.rb
  parameters:
    - name: Filename
      required: true
      description: Ruby file which contains the background task implementation.
        Must inherit from BackgroundTask and implement the call method.
      values: '.+\.rb'
    - name: Optional Arguments
      required: false
      description: Optional arguments to the background task constructor
      values: .+
