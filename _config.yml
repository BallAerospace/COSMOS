# Collections are specified as a name and correspond to a directory
# that consists of the name prepended with '_', e.g. _docs_v4
# Collections are accessed in Jekyll directly via site.docs_v4
# or indirectly via site['docs_v4']
# Note the collection name is available from the page, e.g. page.collection
# Thus you can do site[page.collection] to access the collection
