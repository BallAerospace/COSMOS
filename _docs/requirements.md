COSMOS is a command and control system providing commanding, scripting, and data visualization capabilities for embedded systems and systems of systems. COSMOS is intended for use during all phases of testing (board, box, integrated system) and during operations.

COSMOS is made up of the following 15 applications:

1. **Command and Telemetry Server** - Provides realtime commanding, telemetry reception, logging, limits monitoring, and packet routing.
2. **Replay** - Simulates Command and Telemetry Server for telemetry packet log file playback.
3. **Command Sender** - Provides a graphical interface for manually sending individual commands.
4. **Script Runner** - Executes test scripts and provides highlighting of the currently executing line.
5. **Test Runner** - Provides a high level framework for system level testing including test report generation.
6. **Packet Viewer** - Provides realtime visualization of every telemetry packet that has been defined.
7. **Telemetry Viewer** - Provides custom telemetry screen functionality with advanced layout and visualization widgets.
8. **Telemetry Grapher** - Provides realtime and offline graphing of telemetry data.
9. **Data Viewer** - Provides text based telemetry visualization for items.
10. **Limits Monitor** - Monitors telemetry with defined limits and shows items that currently are or have violated limits.
11. **Telemetry Extractor** - Extracts telemetry packet log files into CSV data.
12. **Command Extractor** - Extracts command packet log files into human readable text.
13. **Table Manager** - A binary file editor that can be used to build up configuration tables or other binary data.
14. **Handbook Creator** - Creates html and pdf documentation of available commands and telemetry packets.
15. **Launcher** - Provides a graphical interface for launching each of the tools that make up the COSMOS system.

More detailed descriptions, requirements, and design for each tool are found later in this document.  Additionally, each of the above applications is built using COSMOS libraries that are available for use as a framework to develop custom program/project applications.

## Terminology

The COSMOS system uses several terms that are important to understand.  The following table defines these terms.

| Term | Definition |
|------|----------|
| Target | A COSMOS target is an embedded system that the COSMOS Command and Telemetry Server connects using and interface in in order to send commands to and/or receive telemetry from. |
| Command | A packet of information telling a target to perform an action of some sort. |
| Telemetry Packet | A packet of information providing status from a target. |
| Interface | A Ruby class that knows how to send commands to and/or receive telemetry from a target. COSMOS comes with interfaces that support TCP/IP, UDP, and serial connections. Custom interfaces are easy to add to the system. |
| Ruby | The powerful dynamic programming language used to write the COSMOS applications and libraries as well as COSMOS scripts and test procedures. |
| Configuration Files | COSMOS uses simple plain text configuration files to define commands and telemetry packets, and to configure each COSMOS application.   These files are easily human readable/editable and machine readable/editable. |
| Packet Log Files | Binary files containing either logged commands or telemetry packets. |
| Message Log Files | Text files containing messages generated by a tool. |
| Tool | Another name for a COSMOS application. |

## Overall Architecture and Context Diagram

The following diagram shows how the 15 applications that make up the COSMOS system relate to each other and to the targets that COSMOS is controlling.

<img src="/img/COSMOS_Architecture.png" alt="COSMOS Architecture">

Key aspects of this architecture:

 * The COSMOS tools are grouped into four broad categories:
     * Realtime Commanding and Scripting
     * Realtime Telemetry Visualization
     * Offline Analysis
     * Utilities
 * COSMOS can connect to many different kinds of targets.   The examples shown in this diagram include Flight software (FSW), Ground Support Equipment (GSE), Labview, and a COTS target such as an Agilent power supply.   Any embedded system that provides a communication interface can be connected to COSMOS.
 * COSMOS ships with interfaces for connecting over TCP/IP, UDP, and serial connections.  This covers most systems, but custom interfaces can also be written to connect to anything that a computer can talk to.
 * All realtime communication with targets flows through the Command and Telemetry Server.  This ensures all commands and telemetry are logged.
 * Every tool is configured with plain text configuration files.
 * Program specific tools can be written using the COSMOS libraries that can interact with the realtime command and telemetry streams through the COSMOS Command and Telemetry Server and can process packet log files.

## Script Runner

Script Runner provides a visual interface for editing and executing test scripts/procedures.   A full featured text editor provided syntax highlighting and code completion while developing test procedures.   During script execution, the currently executing line is highlighted and any logged messages are highlighted to the user.  If any failure occurs, the script is paused and the user altered.   The user can then decide whether to stop the script, or ignore the failure and continue.   The user can also retry the failed lines, or other nearby lines before proceeding.

## Test Runner

Test Runner provides a structured methodology for designing system level testing that mirrors the very successful pattern used in software unit tests.   System level tests are built up of test cases that are organized into test groups.  For example, you might have one test group that verified all of the requirements associated with a particular mechanism.   Ideally you would break this down into individual test cases for different scenarios.  One perhaps for opening a shutter, another for closing it, etc.   Test cases are ideally small and independent tasks.  A number of these test groups are then combined into an overall test suite which would be run to execute a major test such as EMI, or software FQT.
