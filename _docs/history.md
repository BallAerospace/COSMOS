## 3.2.1 / 2015-02-23
{: #v3-2-1}

### Issues:

* [#61](https://github.com/BallAerospace/COSMOS/issues/61) Don't crash TestRunner if there is an error during require_utilities()
* [#63](https://github.com/BallAerospace/COSMOS/issues/63) Creating interfaces with the same name does not cause an error
* [#64](https://github.com/BallAerospace/COSMOS/issues/64) Launcher RUBYW substitution broken by refactor
* [#65](https://github.com/BallAerospace/COSMOS/issues/65) CmdTlmServer ensure log messages start scrolled to bottom on Linux
* [#66](https://github.com/BallAerospace/COSMOS/issues/66) Improve graceful shutdown on linux and prevent continuous exceptions from InterfaceThread
* [#70](https://github.com/BallAerospace/COSMOS/issues/70) ask() should take a default

### Migration Notes from COSMOS 3.1.x:

No significant updates to existing code should be needed. The primary reason for update to 3.2.x is fixing the slow shutdown present in all of 3.1.x.

### Migration Notes from COSMOS 3.0.x:

The definition of limits persistence has changed. Before it only applied when changing to a bad state (yellow or red). Now persistence applies for all changes including from stale to a valid state and from bad states back to green.
