For the impatient, here's how to get a COSMOS demo configuration up and running.

{% highlight bash %}
~ $ gem install cosmos
~ $ cosmos demo demo
~ $ cd demo
~/demo $ ruby Launcher
# => Now launch the COSMOS tools
{% endhighlight %}

This is only COSMOS running against a simulation.  The real power of COSMOS comes when
connecting it to real hardware.

If you're running into problems, ensure you have all the [requirements
installed][Installation].
